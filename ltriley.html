<p>Simon “Ghost” Riley is an elite, enigmatic operative in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II and Modern Warfare III, 
    known for his iconic skull-patterned balaclava and dry, sardonic wit. As a key member of Task Force 141, Ghost
     is highly skilled, fiercely loyal, and brutally efficient, specializing in covert operations and direct assaults
      alike. Beneath his masked, intimidating exterior lies a soldier shaped by betrayal and loss, driven by duty and
       an unyielding resolve to eliminate threats to global security.</p>
